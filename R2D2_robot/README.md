# I am working on a making a R2D2 model robot for fun. 

My first attempt is using an Arduino that parses a signal from a radio receiver, allowing the user to drive the robot around. It uses stepper motors instead of servos for the wheels because I has the laying around.   

I plan to switch the Arduino out for a Raspberry Pi. The pi will host a express web server and provide client computers with a React UI for controlling and driving the robot. I plan to also include a camera, streaming video to the user.
